## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/josethomas45/datastructure-lab.git
   ```

2. **Open the project**:
   Navigate to the cloned folder to explore various data structures and their implementations.

3. **Run the Examples**:
   - You can run the individual files in each folder to see how the data structures work in practice. For example, to run the stack implementation:
   ```bash
   python stacks/stack.py
   ```

## Key Data Structures Included

1. **Arrays**:
   - Basic operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.

2. **Linked Lists**:
   - Implementations of singly and doubly linked lists with operations for insertion, deletion, and searching.

3. **Stacks**:
   - Operations such as push, pop, and peek using an array or linked list implementation.

4. **Queues**:
   - Implementation of queue operations using arrays and linked lists.

5. **Trees**:
   - Binary tree implementation with operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.

6. **Graphs**:
   - Graph representation using adjacency list and matrix with basic operations for traversal.

## Requirements

- **Programming Language**: The examples are primarily implemented in Python. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine to run the scripts.
- **IDE/Text Editor**: Any IDE or text editor of your choice for editing and running the code.
